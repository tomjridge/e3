  - functorization
    - introduced functors to e3_simple.ml, code compiles to e3_simple.ml[i]
    - now need to introduce similar changes to e3_array, after first introducing a .mli file for e3_array

Sample timings with functors (but no heap resize):

tr61@pc1177:/tmp/l/github/super/e3/build$ ./e3_examples.native 
Start example 833 ......stop in 0.297599 seconds
Start example u5o ......stop in 2.549507 seconds
Start example 86f ......stop in 0.271831 seconds
Start example 17y ......stop in 2.456628 seconds

Some timings with poly (but no heap resize):

Start example 833 ......stop in 0.300432 seconds
Start example u5o ......stop in 2.609769 seconds
Start example 86f ......stop in 0.285397 seconds
Start example 17y ......stop in 2.538197 seconds

  - map/set types
    - functorize, or parameterize? these can't be see from the
      outside; but they do depend on an ordering; so keep types
      abstract... but the ordering is an essential part of having the
      type; but maybe this is only done at initialization time; so we
      need a way of saying (when instantiating the fixed but abstract
      types) that this operation belongs to this type, even though we
      are ultimately going to assert the type is equal to some other
      type
