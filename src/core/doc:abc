Take the oracle, an nt_item and an int j, and return the updated oracle.

The nt_item is of the form X -> xs.y ys,i,k

The j indicates that y could be parsed from k to posn j:

i xs k y j

Thus, the key is (xs,y,i,j), and we need to insert k into the map.

FIXME perhaps the key should rather be i xs y j ?
