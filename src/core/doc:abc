Take the oracle, an nt_item and an int l, and return the updated oracle.

The nt_item is of the form X -> xs.y ys,i,j

The l indicates that y could be parsed from j to posn l:

i xs j y l

Thus, the key is (xs,y,i,l), and we need to insert j into the map.

FIXME perhaps the key should rather be i xs y l ?

FIXME there is a mismatch between the i,j used in items, and the i,k,j
used in cut spans.
