Take a blocked item, and a complete item, and produce a new item to be
processed.

The blocked item `bitm` is of the form `X -> xs.y ys,i,j`

The complete item citm is of the form `X,j,k`

The new item `nitm` is `X -> y::xs,ys,i,k` (since the `xs` is stored
in reverse order).

`cut` checks that `nitm` is new, and if so it is added to the list of
items that need processing via `add_todo`.

`cut` now updates the oracle, as well as `todo_done`.
